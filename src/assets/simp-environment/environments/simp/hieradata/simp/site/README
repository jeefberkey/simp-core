== Hiera SIMP Site Directory ==

This directory will be populated with a yaml file containing answers to
questions given by `simp config`. Any Hieradata or yaml files dropped in this
folder will overwrite any defaults provided by any SIMP scenario. However, more
specific level of Hiera, such as hostgroups or hosts, will overwrite any data
placed here.
